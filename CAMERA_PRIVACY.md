# Camera Processing Explanation
"""
How the Barcode Scanner Camera Works:
=====================================

🔍 INSTANT PROCESSING ONLY:
- Camera captures frame
- Frame analyzed for barcodes immediately  
- Only barcode TEXT extracted (e.g., "ABC123XYZ789")
- Original image frame discarded
- Process repeats with next frame

🚫 NO VIDEO RECORDING:
- No .mp4, .avi, or video files created
- No frames saved to disk
- No video buffering or storage
- Memory cleared after each scan

⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Process every 3rd frame (skip 2 frames for speed)
- Resize images for faster analysis
- 1.5 second cooldown between scans
- Automatic memory cleanup

🛡️ PRIVACY FEATURES:
- All processing happens locally on your device
- No video data sent to internet
- No cloud storage of camera feed
- Session-only data storage
- Close app = all data deleted

📱 MOBILE/DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
- Image upload mode as backup (no live camera needed)
- Works on any device with camera
- HTTPS required for camera access (automatic on Streamlit Cloud)
- Users can deny camera permission and use image upload instead

    "image_buffers": "❌ Cleared immediately",
    "user_face": "❌ Not captured or analyzed",
    "background": "❌ Only barcode area processed"
